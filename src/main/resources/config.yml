# Reward mode. Weight / Roll
# Weight: Every drop's weight/chance will get added to a list and a number will be randomly generated from 0-[Total Weight] which will decide the reward.
# For example, if you had 2 items in the loot table, one with 60 weight and another with 40 weight, they would have 60% & 40% drop chance respectively.
#
# Roll: Drops will cycle from the lowest chance to highest until the player rolls an item. (Chance should not be higher than 100)
# For example, if you had 3 items with 1%, 10%, 100% chance, and the player rolls a 9, the 10% item will drop, but if he rolls an 11, the 100% item will drop.
